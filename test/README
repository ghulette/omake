OMake test suite
================

This directory contains number of automatic tests for OMake, spread
out over a number of subdirectories.  Each subdirectory constitutes a
"test group" and contains a number of individual tests.

To run the tests, run "omake check", either in the top omake directory
or in the tests directory.  The test logs will be written to a file
called "result.log" in each log group.

Mechanics
=========

Each individual test has a name "TestN", where N is a number, and is
written either as a simple osh script with that name, or as a
subdirectory.  If it is a script, it will be run and the exit status
is used to indicate success or failure (0 for success).

If the test is written as a directory, it should contain either a
"run.osh" file or an "OMakeroot" file.  If the "run.osh" file exists,
it will be run in the same way as if he test had been written as a
single script.  If no script is found, "omake" will be run in the test
directory, which will use the "OMakeroot".  The exit status of omake
is used to indicate success or failure.

Writing test cases
==================

If you have a test test that can be written as a self-contained osh
script, you don't have to use a subdirectory for the test, and instead
write it to a file called "TestN". But for other cases, where you have
other files, or where you are checking for correct output, you should
create a subdirectory for your test.
