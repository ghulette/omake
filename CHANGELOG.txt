OMake 0.9.6 [07/17/2005]

  - Added "static" sections that are evaluated once.
  - Added :value: dependencies, where a target depends on a computed
    value, rather than a file.
  - Changed the meaning of the .SCANNER rules.  .SCANNER rules
    are now much more similar to normal rules.

  - Fixed issues where files were being expanded during the string->array
    conversion.
  - Rule execution now fails when any shell command fails, even those in
    nested sections.

    lexer has better performance, searching is now roughly linear time.

    in a subdirectory.
  - Added the vmount function to define a "virtual mount" of one directory
    over another.
  - Better accessibility of the build rules and dependencies from OMake
    scripts.
  - Improved the latex-related rules.
  - The Map object is completely changed.
  - Other bug fixes and improvements.

OMake 0.9.5 [skipped]

OMake 0.9.4 [01/04/2005]
  - Portability improvements. OMake should now compile and work under Windows
    2000, Windows NT and FreeBSD. A number of Windows-specific bugs are fixed.
    A Windows installer is added.
  - OMake now uses the built-in versions of the following commands:
	 cp, mv, mkdir, rm, rmdir, chmod
  - Improvements to the filesystem watch functionality. In particular,
    the build will now restart if a change to one of the OMakefiles is
    detected.
  - Added a USE_OCAMLFIND variable that can be used to force or prohibit the
    usage of ocamlfind in a project (by default USE_OCAMLFIND is set to true
    iff the ocamlfind executable is found in path).
  - Added a "--force-dotomake" option to create all .omc and .omo files
	 under $HOME/.omake/cache and a "--dotomake" option to specify an alternative
    to $HOME/.omake
  - Added :squash: dependencies (that specify that the dependency must be
    built, but when the dependency changes, it does not cause the target to be
    rebuilt).
  - OMake will now read ~/.omakeinit and ~/.omakerc files on startup.
  - Improved the latex-related rules.
  - Documentation improvements.
  - Bugs fixed: 142, 153, 311, 313, 314, 316, 332, 333, 339, 350, 360, 361,
    366, 367, 368, 374, 375. See
    http://bugzilla.metaprl.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=142,153,311,313,314,316,332,333,339,350,360,361,366,367,368,374,375
    for details.

OMake 0.9.3 [10/18/2004]
  - OMake now supports ocamlfind in its default configuration file
   (thanks to Bardur Arantsson for the initial patch).
  - OMake should now also work with OCaml 3.07 (in addition to 3.08).
  - A large number of bug fixes, including:
     o OMake should now compile correctly under Cygwin (thanks to
       Peter Jolly who provided the patch),
     o "double-colon" rules (that allow specifying multiple rules for
       the same target) should now work correctly,
     o kqueue-based file system monitoring (Mac OS X, FreeBSD) should
       now work correctly
     o array definitions should now work better.
  - Added a work around for the command line length limitation of
    lib.exe on Windows
  - Filesystem monitoring functionality now provides a choice whether
      to continue monitoring once the project is built successfully.

OMake 0.9.2 [09/08/2004]
  - Bugs fixed:
     o "make install" will no longer create $HOME/.omake as root;
     o the -custom option is now a part of OCAML_BYTE_LINK_FLAGS and
       can be easily disabled;
     o omake should now allow specifying dependencies for the same file
       more than once.
  - The OMakeroot.src, OMakeroot.default and OMakefile.default are now
     under MIT license to allow users to freely borrow from them into their
     own omake build files. (The rest of OMake is still under GPL).
  - Fixed a number of typos and formatting errors in documentation.
