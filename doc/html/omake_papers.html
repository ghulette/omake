         <h4>Abstract</h4>
         <blockquote>
         Modern software codebases are frequently large, heterogeneous, and
         constantly evolving.  The languages and tools for software
         construction, including code builds and configuration management,
         have not been well-studied.  Developers are often faced with using 1)
         older tools (like make) that do not scale well, 2) custom build
         scripts that tend to be fragile, or 3) proprietary tools that are not
         portable.

         <p>In this paper, we study the build issue as a domain-specific
         programming problem.  There are a number of challenges that are
         unique to the domain of build systems.  We argue that a central goal
         is compositionality&mdash;that is, it should be possible to specify a
         software component in isolation and add it to a project with an
         assurance that the global specification will not be compromised.  The
         next important goal is to cover the full range of
         complexity&mdash;from allowing very concise specifications for the
         most common cases to providing the flexibility to encompass projects
         with unusual needs.  Dependency analysis, which is a prerequisite for
         incremental builds, must be automated in order to achieve
         compositionality an reliability; it also spans the full range of
         complexity.

         <p>We develop a language for describing software builds and
         configuration.  We also develop an implementation (called OMake),
         that addresses all the above challenges efficiently and portably. It
         also provides a number of features that help streamline the
         edit/compile development cycle.

         <p>OMake is freely available under the GNU General Public License,
         and is actively being used in several large projects.
