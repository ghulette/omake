11.7   Grouping
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  Parenthesis are used for grouping in a pipeline or conditional
command. In the following expression, the `test' function is used to
test whether the `foo.exe' file is executable. If it is, the `foo.exe'
file is executed. If the file is not executable (or if the `foo.exe'
command fails), the message `"foo.exe is not executable"' is printed.
<<   # Run foo.exe, or print an error message
     (test -x foo.exe && foo.exe) || echo "foo.exe is not executable"
>>

11.8   What is a shell command?
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  Syntactially, shell commands are any line that is not one of the
following:
  
  
 - A variable definition of the form `VAR=string' 
 - A function call `f(...)' or method call `o.f(...)' 
 - A rule definition containing a colon `string: ...' 
 - A special command, including the following: 
     
    - `if ...' 
    - `switch ...' 
    - `match ...' 
    - `section ...' 
    - `return ...' 
  
  
  Commands may also be builtin (aliases). See the documentation for the
'Shell' object for more information.

11.9.2   cd
===========

  The `cd' function changes the current directory.
<<    cd(dir)
         dir : Dir
>>
  
  The `cd' function also supports a 2-argument form:
<<    $(cd dir, e)
         dir : Dir
         e : expression
>>
  
  In the two-argument form, expression `e' is evaluated in the directory
`dir'. The current directory is not changed otherwise.
  The behavior of the `cd' function can be changed with the `CDPATH'
variable, which specifies a search path for directories. This is
normally useful only in the osh command interpreter.
<<    CDPATH : Dir Sequence
>>
  
  For example, the following will change directory to the first
directory `./foo', `~/dir1/foo', `~/dir2/foo'.
<<    CDPATH[] =
         .
         $(HOME)/dir1
         $(HOME)/dir2
      cd foo

12.1.1   Object
===============

  Parent objects: none.
  The `Object' object is the root object. Every class is a subclass of
`Object'.
  It provides the following fields:
  
  
 - `$(o.object-length)': the number of fields and methods in the object.
   
 - `$(o.object-mem <var>)': returns `true' iff the `<var>' is a field or
   method of the object. 
 - `$(o.object-add <var>, <value>)': adds the field to the object,
   returning a new object. 
 - `$(o.object-find <var>)': fetches the field or method from the
   object; it is equivalent to `$(o.<var>)', but the variable can be
   non-constant. 
 - `$(o.object-map <fun>)': maps a function over the object. The
   function should take two arguments; the first is a field name, the
   second is the value of that field. The result is a new object
   constructed from the values returned by the function. 
 - `o.object-foreach': the `object-foreach' form is equivalent to
   `object-map', but with altered syntax.
   <<   o.object-foreach(<var1>, <var2>)
           <body>
        >>
 
 For example, the following function prints all the fields of an object
   `o'.
   <<   PrintObject(o) =
           o.object-foreach(v, x)
              println($(v) = $(x))
        >>
 
 The `export' form is valid in a `object-foreach' body. The following
   function collects just the field names of an object.
   <<   FieldNames(o) =
           names[] =
           o.object-foreach(v, x)
              names[] += $(v)
              export
           return $(names)
        >>

12.1.2   Map
============

  Parent objects: `Object'.
  A `Map' object is a dictionary from values to values. The `<key>'
values are restricted to simple values: integers, floating-point
numbers, strings, files, directories, and arrays of simple values.
  The Map object provides the following methods.
  
  
 - `$(o.length)': the number of items in the map. 
 - `$(o.mem <key>)': returns `true' iff the `<key>' is defined in the
   map. 
 - `$(o.add <key>, <value>)': adds the field to the map, returning a new
   map. 
 - `$(o.find <key>)': fetches the field from the map. 
 - `$(o.keys)': fetches an array of all the keys in the map, in
   alphabetical order. 
 - `$(o.values)': fetches an array of all the values in the map, in the
   alphabetical order of the corresponding keys. 
 - `$(o.map <fun>)': maps a function over the map. The function should
   take two arguments; the first is a field name, the second is the
   value of that field. The result is a new object constructed from the
   values returned by the function. 
 - `o.foreach': the `foreach' form is equivalent to `map', but with
   altered syntax.
   <<   o.foreach(<var1>, <var2>)
           <body>
        >>
 
 For example, the following function prints all the fields of an object
   `o'.
   <<   PrintObject(o) =
           o.foreach(v, x)
              println($(v) = $(x))
        >>
 
 The `export' form is valid in a `foreach' body. The following function
   collects just the field names of the map.
   <<   FieldNames(o) =
           names =
           o.foreach(v, x)
              names += $(v)
              export
           return $(names)
        >>
  
  There is also simpler syntax when the key is a string. The table can
be defined using definitions with the form `$|key|' (the number of pipe
symbols `|' is allowed to vary).
<<    $|key 1| = value1
      $||key1|key2|| = value2    # The key is key1|key2
      X = $|key 1|               # Define X to be the value of field
$|key 1|
>>
  
  The usual modifiers are also allowed. The expression `$`|key|'
represents lazy evaluation of the key, and `$,|key|' is normal
evaluation.

12.1.6   Sequence
=================

  Parent objects: `Object'.
  The `Sequence' object represents a generic object containing
sequential elements. It provides the following methods.
  
  
 - `$(s.length)': the number of elements in the sequence. 
 - `$(s.map <fun>)': maps a function over the fields in the sequence.
   The function should take one argument. The result is a new sequence
   constructed from the values returned by the function. 
 - `s.foreach': the `foreach' form is equivalent to `map', but with
   altered syntax.
   <<   s.foreach(<var>)
           <body>
        >>
 
 For example, the following function prints all the elements of the
   sequence.
   <<   PrintSequence(s) =
           s.foreach(x)
              println(Elem = $(x))
        >>
 
 The `export' form is valid in a `foreach' body. The following function
   counts the number of zeros in the sequence.
   <<   Zeros(s) =
           count = $(int 0)
           s.foreach(v)
              if $(equal $(v), 0)
                 count = $(add $(count), 1)
                 export
              export
           return $(count)
        >>
 
 
 - `$(s.forall <fun>)': tests whether each element of the sequence
   satifies a predicate. 
 - `$(s.exists <fun>)': tests whether the sequence contains an element
   that satisfies a predicate. 
 - `$(s.sort <fun>)': sorts a sequence. The `<fun>' is a comparison
   function. It takes two elements `(x, y)' of the sequence, compares
   them, and returns a negative number if x < y, a positive number if x
   > y, and zero if the two elements are equal.
   <<  osh> items = $(int 0 3 -2)
       osh> items.forall(x => $(gt $x, 0))
       - : bool = false
       osh> items.exists(x => $(gt $x, 0))
       - : bool = true
       osh> items.sort($(compare))
       - : Array = -2 3 0

12.1.11   Target
================

  Parent object: `Object'.
  The `Target' object contains information collected for a specific
target file.
  
  
 - `target': the target file. 
 - `effects': the files that may be modified by a side-effect when this
   target is built. 
 - `scanner_deps': static dependencies that must be built before this
   target can be scanned. 
 - `static-deps': statically-defined build dependencies of this target. 
 - `build-deps': all the build dependencies for the target, including
   static and scanned dependencies. 
 - `build-values': all the value dependencies associated with the build.
   
 - `build-commands': the commands to build the target. 
 - `output-file': if output was diverted to a file, with one of the
   `--output-*' options A*Note Appendix A::, this field names
   that file. Otherwise it is `false'. 
  
  The object supports the following methods.
  
  
 - `find(file)': returns a Target object for the given file. Raises a
   `RuntimeException' if the specified target is not part of the
   project. 
 - `find-optional(file)': returns a `Target' object for the given file,
   or `false' if the file is not part of the project. 
  
  NOTE: the information for a target is constructed dynamically, so it
is possible that the `Target' object for a node will contain different
values in different contexts. The easiest way to make sure that the
`Target' information is complete is to compute it within a rule body,
where the rule depends on the target file, or the dependencies of the
target file.

 - `jobs'
 The `jobs' method prints the status of currently running commands. 
 - `cd'
 The `cd' function changes the current directory. Note that the current
   directory follows the usual scoping rules. For example, the following
   program lists the files in the `foo' directory, but the current
   directory is not changed.
   <<   section
           echo Listing files in the foo directory...
           cd foo
           ls
     
        echo Listing files in the current directory...
        ls
   >>
 
 - `bg'
 The `bg' method places a job in the background. The job is resumed if
   it has been suspended. 
 - `fg'
 The `fg' method brings a job to the foreground. The job is resumed if
   it has been suspended. 
 - `stop'
 The `stop' method suspends a running job. 
 - `wait'
 The `wait' function waits for a running job to terminate. It is not
   possible to wait for a suspended job.
 The job is not brought to the foreground. If the `wait' is interrupted,
   the job continues to run in the background. 
 - `kill'
 The `kill' function signal a job.
 `kill [signal] <pid...>'.
 The signals are either numeric, or symbolic. The symbolic signals are
   named as follows.
 ABRT, ALRM, HUP, ILL, KILL, QUIT, SEGV, TERM, USR1, USR2, CHLD, STOP,
   TSTP, TTIN, TTOU, VTALRM, PROF. 
 - `exit'
 The `exit' function terminates the current session. 
 - `which', `where'
 See the documentation for the corresponding functions. 
 - `rehash'
 Reset the search path. 
 - `ln-or-cp' src dst
 Links or copies src to dst, overwriting dst. Namely, `ln-or-cp' would
   first delete the dst file (unless it is a directory), if it exists.
   Next it would try to create a symbolic link dst poiting to src (it
   will make all the necessary adjustmnents of relative paths). If
   symbolic link can not be created (e.g. the OS or the filesystem does
   not support symbolic links), it will try to create a hard link. If
   that fails too, it will try to forcibly copy src to dst. 
 - `history'
 Print the current command-line history. 
 - `digest'
 Print the digests of the given files. 
 - Win32 functions.
 Win32 doesn't provide very many programs for scripting, except for the
   functions that are builtin to the DOS `cmd.exe'. The following
   functions are defined on Win32 and only on Win32. On other systems,
   it is expected that these programs already exist.
 
     
    - `grep'
      <<   grep [-q] [-n] pattern files...
      >>
    
    The `grep' function calls the omake `grep' function. 
  
 - Internal versions of standard system commands.
 By default, omake uses internal versions of the following commands:
   `cp', `mv', `cat', `rm', `mkdir', `chmod', `test', `find'. If you
   really want to use the standard system versions of these commands,
   set the `USE_SYSTEM_COMMANDS' as one of the first definitions in your
   `OMakeroot' file.
 
     
    - `pwd'
      <<    pwd
      >>
    
    The `pwd' alias would print the absolute path to current directory. 
    - `mkdir'
      <<    mkdir [-m <mode>] [-p] files
      >>
    
    The `mkdir' function is used to create directories. The -verb+-m+
      option can be used to specify the permission mode of the created
      directory. If the `-p' option is specified, the full path is
      created. 
    - `cp' 
    - `mv'
      <<    cp [-f] [-i] [-v] src dst
            cp [-f] [-i] [-v] files dst
            mv [-f] [-i] [-v] src dst
            mv [-f] [-i] [-v] files dst
      >>
    
    The `cp' function copies a `src' file to a `dst' file, overwriting
      it if it already exists. If more than one source file is
      specified, the final file must be a directory, and the source
      files are copied into the directory.
    
        
       -f  Copy files forcibly, do not prompt. 
       -i  Prompt before removing destination files. 
       -v  Explain what is happening. 
     
    - `rm'
      <<   rm [-f] [-i] [-v] [-r] files
           rmdir [-f] [-i] [-v] [-r] dirs
      >>
    
    The `rm' function removes a set of files. No warnings are issued if
      the files do not exist, or if they cannot be removed.
    Options: 
        
       -f  Forcibly remove files, do not prompt. 
       -i  Prompt before removal. 
       -v  Explain what is happening. 
       -r  Remove contents of directories recursively. 
     
    - `chmod'
      <<    chmod [-r] [-v] [-f] mode files
      >>
    
    The `chmod' function changes the permissions on a set of files or
      directories. This function does nothing on Win32. The `mode' may
      be specified as an octal number, or in symbolic form
      `[ugoa]*['-=][rwxXstugo]+. See the man page for `chmod' for
      details.
    Options: 
        
       -r  Change permissions of all files in a directory recursively. 
       -v  Explain what is happening. 
       -f  Continue on errors. 
     
    - `cat'
      <<   cat files...
      >>
    
    The `cat' function prints the contents of the files to stdout 
    - `test'
    `test' expression
     `[' expression +]+
     `[ --help'
     `[ --version'
     See the documentation for the 'test' function.
    
    - `find'
    `find' expression
    See the documentation for the 'find' function.

13.1   Builtin .PHONY targets
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  The complete set of builtin `.PHONY' targets include the following.
  
  
 .PHONY  Declares new phony targets (Section
   8.10*Note Section 8-10::). 
 .DEFAULT  Declare the default build targets (Section
   8.7*Note Section 8-7::). 
 .SUBDIRS  Include a directory as part of the project (Section
   8.8*Note Section 8-8::). 
 .SCANNER  Define a dependency scanner (Section
   8.8*Note Section 8-8::). 
 .INCLUDE  Include a file (Section 8.9*Note Section 8-9::). 
 .ORDER  Define a file-dependency ordering rule (Section
   10.3.6*Note Subsection 10-3-6::). 
 .BUILD_BEGIN  Commands to be executed at the beginning of a build. 
 .BUILD_SUCCESS  Commands to be executed if the build is successful. 
 .BUILD_FAILURE  Commands to be executed if the build fails. 
  



  The `.BUILD' targets can be used to specify commands to be executed at
the beginning and end of the build. The `.BUILD_BEGIN' target is built
at the beginning of a project build, and one of `.BUILD_FAILURE' or
`.BUILD_SUCCESS' is executed when the build terminates.
  For example, the following set of rules simply print additional
messages about the status of the build.
<<   .BUILD_BEGIN:
         echo Build starting
  
     .BUILD_SUCCESS:
         echo The build was successful
  
     .BUILD_FAILURE:
         println($"The build failed: $(length $(find-build-targets
Failed)) targets could not be built")
>>
  
  Another common use is to define notifications to be performed when the
build completes. For example, the following rule will create a new X
terminal displaying the summary of the build (using the 'BUILD_SUMMARY'
variable).
<<    .BUILD_FAILURE:
          xterm -e vi $(BUILD_SUMMARY)
>>
  
  If you do not wish to add these rules directly to your project (which
is probably a good idea if you work with others), you can define them in
your `.omakerc' (see Section A.8*Note Section A-8::).
  The 'find-build-targets' function is useful for obtaining a firther
summary of the build. Note that when output diversions are in effect
(with the `--output-*' options --- see Chapter
A*Note Appendix A::), any output produced by the commands is
copied to a file. The name of the file is specified by the `output-file'
field of the 'Target' object. You may find this useful in defining
custom build summaries.

13.2.1   OMakeFlags
===================

<<   OMakeFlags(options)
        options : String
>>
  
  The `OMakeFlags' function is used to set `omake' options from within
OMakefiles. The options have exactly the same format as options on the
command line.
  For example, the following code displays the progress bar unless the
`VERBOSE' environment variable is defined.
<<    if $(not $(defined-env VERBOSE))
          OMakeFlags(-S --progress)
          export

=====================

<<   OMakeVersion(version1)
     OMakeVersion(version1, version2)
        version1, version2 : String
>>
  
  The `OMakeVersion' function is used for version checking in
OMakefiles. It takes one or two arguments.
  In the one argument form, if the omake version number is less than
`<version1>', then an exception is raised. In the two argument form, the
version must lie between `version1' and `version2'.

13.2.3   cmp-versions
=====================
 
<<   $(cmp-versions version1, version2)
        version1, version2 : String
>>
  
  The `cmp-versions\' functions can be used to compare arbitrary version
strings. It returns 0 when the two version strings are equal, a negative
number when the first string represents an earlier version, and a
positive number otherwise.

13.2.4   DefineCommandVars
==========================

<<   DefineCommandVars()
>>
  
  The `DefineCommandVars' function redefines the variables passed on the
commandline. Variables definitions are passed on the command line in the
form `name=value'. This function is primarily for internal use by omake
to define these variables for the first time.

13.3.1   dependencies, dependencies-all, dependencies-proper
============================================================

<<   $(dependencies targets) : File Array
     $(dependencies-all targets) : File Array
     $(dependencies-proper targets) : File Array
        targets : File Array
     raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `dependencies' function returns the set of immediate dependencies
of the given targets. This function can only be used within a rule body
and all the arguments to the `dependency' function must also be
dependencies of this rule. This restriction ensures that all the
dependencies are known when this function is executed.
  The `dependencies-all' function is similar, but it expands the
dependencies recursively, returning all of the dependencies of a target,
not just the immediate ones.
  The `dependencies-proper' function returns all recursive dependencies,
except the dependencies that are leaf targets. A leaf target is a target
that has no dependencies and no build commands; a leaf target
corresponds to a source file in the current project.
  In all three functions, files that are not part of the current project
are silently discarded. All three functions will return phony and
scanner targets along with the "real" ones.
  One purpose of the `dependencies-proper' function is for "clean"
targets. For example, one way to delete all intermediate files in a
build is with a rule that uses the `dependencies-proper'. Note however,
that the rule requires building the project before it can be deleted.
<<    .PHONY: clean
  
      APP = ...     # the name of the target application
      clean: $(APP)
         rm -f $(dependencies-proper $(APP))
>>
  
  Also note that the `dependencies-proper' function will return the
phony and scanner targets in addition to real one.
  For other (possibly better) alternatives, see Section
10.3.3*Note Subsection 10-3-3:: and 'filter-proper-targets'
function.

13.3.2   target
===============
 
<<   $(target targets) : Target Array
        targets : File Sequence
     raises RuntimeException
>>
  
  The `target' function returns the Target object associated with each
of the targets. See the `Target' object for more information. 

Node: Subsection 13-3-3,	Next: Subsection 13-3-4,	Prev: Subsection 13-3-2,	Up: Section 13-3
  

13.3.3   find-build-targets
===========================

<<    $(find-build-targets tag) : Target Array
         tag : Succeeded | Failed
>>
  
  The `find-build-targets' allow the results of the build to be
examined. The `tag' must specifies which targets are to be returned; the
comparison is case-insensitive.
  
  
 Succeeded  The list of targets that were built successfully. 
 Failed  The list of targets that could not be built. 
  
  These are used mainly in conjuction with the `.BUILD_SUCCESS' (Section
13.1*Note Section 13-1::) and `.BUILD_FAILURE' (Section
13.1*Note Section 13-1::) phony targets. For example,
adding the following to your project `OMakefile' will print the number
of targets that failed (if the build failed).
<<    .BUILD_FAILURE:
          echo "Failed target count: $(length $(find-build-targets
Failed))"
>>

13.3.4   project-directories
============================

<<   $(project-directories) : Dir Array
>>
  
  The `project-directories' function returns the list of all directories
that are considered to be part of the project.
  To get the complete directory list, this function should be called
from within a rule body. 

Node: Subsection 13-3-5,	Next: Subsection 13-3-6,	Prev: Subsection 13-3-4,	Up: Section 13-3
  

13.3.5   rule
=============

  The `rule' function is called whenever a build rule is defined. It is
unlikely that you will need to redefine this function, except in very
exceptional cases.
<<   rule(multiple, target, pattern, sources, options, body) : Rule
        multiple : String
        target   : Sequence
        pattern  : Sequence
        sources  : Sequence
        options  : Array
        body     : Body
>>
  
  The `rule' function is called when a rule is evaluated.
  
  
 multiple  A Boolean value indicating whether the rule was defined with
   a double colon `::'. 
 target  The sequence of target names. 
 pattern  The sequence of patterns. This sequence will be empty for
   two-part rules. 
 sources  The sequence of dependencies. 
 options  An array of options. Each option is represented as a 'Map'
   object associating each specified option with a value. 
 body  The body expression of the rule. 
  
  Consider the following rule.
<<   target: pattern: sources :name1: option1 :name2: option2
        expr1
        expr2
>>
  
  This expression represents the following function call, where square
brackets are used to indicate arrays, and the curly brackets represent a
'Map' object.
<<   rule(false, target, pattern, sources,
          { $|:name1:| = option1; $|:name2:| = option2 }
          [expr1; expr2])

 EMPTY
 The empty string. 
 STDROOT
 The name of the standard installed
OMakeroot file. 
 ABORT_ON_COMMAND_ERROR
 If set to true, the construction of a
target should be aborted whenever one of the commands to build it fail.
This defaults to true, and should normally be left that way.
 SCANNER_MODE
 This variable should be defined as one
of four values (defaults to `enabled'). 
  
 enabled  Allow the use of default `.SCANNER' rules. Whenever a rule
   does not specify a `:scanner:' dependency explicitly, try to find a
   `.SCANNER' with the same target name. 
 disabled  Never use default `.SCANNER' rules. 
 warning  Allow the use of default `.SCANNER' rules, but print a warning
   whenever one is selected. 
 error  Do not allow the use of default `.SCANNER' rules. If a rule does
   not specify a `:scanner:' dependency, and there is a default
   `.SCANNER' rule, the build will terminate abnormally.

13.5.1   Autoconfiguration variables
====================================
   These variables will get defined based on the "autoconf-style"
`static.' tests executed when you run OMake for the first time. You can
use them to configure your project accordingly, and you should not
redefine them.
  You can use the `--configure' command line option (Section
A.3.9*Note Subsection A-3-9::) to force re-execution of all the
tests.
  A different set of autoconfiguration tests is performed depending on
the build environment involved --- one set of tests would be performed
in a `Win32' environment, and another --- in a Unix-like environment
(including Linux, OS X and Cygwin).

13.5.3   Generated C files
==========================
   Because the C scanners do not normally know anything about generated
source files (such as generated header files), these files may need to
be created before running the scanner.

13.5.3.1   CGeneratedFiles, LocalCGeneratedFiles
------------------------------------------------
\@name
{function:LocalCGeneratedFiles} 
<<CGeneratedFiles(files)
  LocalCGeneratedFiles(files)
>>
  
  The `CGeneratedFiles' and `LocalCGeneratedFiles' functions specify
files that need to be generated before any C files are scanned for
dependencies. For example, if `config.h' and `inputs.h' are both
generated files, specify: 
<<CGeneratedFiles(config.h inputs.h)
>>
  
  The `CGeneratedFiles' function is global --- its arguments will be
generated before any C files anywhere in the project are scanned for
dependencies. The `LocalCGeneratedFiles' function follows the normal
scoping rules of OMake.

13.5.4   Building C programs and Libraries
==========================================


13.5.4.1   StaticCLibrary, DynamicCLibrary
------------------------------------------

  The `StaticCLibrary' builds a static library and the `DynamicCLibrary'
function builds a shared library (DLL).
<<StaticCLibrary(<target>, <files>)
  DynamicCLibrary(<target>, <files>)
>>
  
  The `<target>' does not include the library suffix, and The `<files>'
list does not include the object suffix. These are obtained from the
'EXT_LIB' ('EXT_DLL') and 'EXT_OBJ' variables.
  This function returns the library filename.
  The following command builds the library `libfoo.a' from the files
`a.o b.o c.o' on `Unix', or the library `libfoo.lib' from the files
`a.obj b.obj c.obj' on `Win32'.
<<StaticCLibrary(libfoo, a b c)
  .DEFAULT: $(StaticCLibrary libbar, a b c d)
>>
  
 CDLL_IMPLIES_STATIC
 If the `CDLL_IMPLIES_STATIC' variable
is enabled (this is default on `Win32'), all the `DynamicC' functions
would assume that creating a shared library automatically created a
static one.

13.5.4.2   StaticCLibraryCopy, DynamicCLibraryCopy
--------------------------------------------------
\@n
ame{function:DynamicCLibraryCopy}
  The `StaticCLibraryCopy' and `DynamicCLibraryCopy' functions copy a
library to an install location.
<<StaticCLibraryCopy(<tag>, <dir>, <lib>)
  DynamicCLibraryCopy(<tag>, <dir>, <lib>)
>>
  
  The `<tag>' is the name of a target (typically a `.PHONY' target); the
`<dir>' is the installation directory, and `<lib>' is the library to be
copied (without the library suffix).
  This function returns the filename of the library in the target
directory.
  For example, the following code copies the library `libfoo.a' to the
`/usr/lib' directory.
<<.PHONY: install
  
  StaticCLibraryCopy(install, /usr/lib, libfoo)
>>
  

13.5.4.3   StaticCLibraryInstall, DynamicCLibraryInstall
--------------------------------------------------------


  The `StaticCLibraryInstall' and `DynamicCLibraryInstall' functions
build a library, and set the install location in one step. Return the
filename of the library in the target directory.
<<StaticCLibraryInstall(<tag>, <dir>, <libname>, <files>)
  DynamicCLibraryInstall(<tag>, <dir>, <libname>, <files>)
>>
  
<<StaticCLibraryInstall(install, /usr/lib, libfoo, a b c)
>>
  

13.5.4.4   StaticCObject, StaticCObjectCopy, StaticCObjectInstall
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  These functions mirror the `StaticCLibrary', `StaticCLibraryCopy', and
`StaticCLibraryInstall' functions, but they build an object file (a `.o'
file on `Unix', and a `.obj' file on `Win32').

13.5.4.5   CProgram
-------------------

  The `CProgram' function builds a C program from a set of object files
and libraries.
  `CProgram(<name>, <files>)'
  The `<name>' argument specifies the name of the program to be built;
the `<files>' argument specifies the files to be linked. The function
returns the filename of the executable.
  Additional options can be passed through the following variables. 
  
 CFLAGS  Flags used by the C compiler during the link step. 
 LDFLAGS  Flags to pass to the loader. 
 LIBS  Additional libraries to be linked. 
  
  For example, the following code specifies that the program `foo' is to
be produced by linking the files `bar.o' and `baz.o' and libraries
`libfoo.a'.
<<section
     LIBS = libfoo
     LDFLAGS += -lbar
     CProgram(foo, bar baz)
>>
  

13.5.4.6   CProgramCopy
-----------------------

  The `CProgramCopy' function copies a file to an install location.
  `CProgramCopy(<tag>, <dir>, <program>)'
<<CProgramCopy(install, /usr/bin, foo)
>>
  

13.5.4.7   CProgramInstall
--------------------------

  The `CProgramInstall' function specifies a program to build, and a
location to install, simultaneously.
  `CProgramInstall(<tag>, <dir>, <name>, <files>)'
<<section
     LIBS = libfoo
     LDFLAGS += -lbar
     CProgramInstall(install, /usr/bin, foo, bar baz)
>>
  

13.5.4.8   CXXProgram, CXXProgramInstall
----------------------------------------

  The `CXXProgram' and `CXXProgramInstall' functions are equivalent to
their C counterparts, except that would use `$(CXX)' and `$(CXXFLAGS)'
for linking instead of `$(CC)' and `$(CFLAGS)'.

13.5.4.9   StaticCXXLibrary, StaticCXXLibraryCopy,
--------------------------------------------------
StaticCXXLibraryInstall, DynamicCXXLibrary, DynamicCXXLibraryCopy,
------------------------------------------------------------------
DynamicCXXLibraryInstall
------------------------
\@nam
e{function:StaticCXXLibraryCopy}\@name
{function:StaticCXXLibraryInstall}\@na
me{function:DynamicCXXLibrary}
  Similarly, the six `CXXLibrary' functions the C++ equivalents of the
corresponding `CLibrary' functions.

13.6   Building OCaml code
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

  
  OMake provides extensive support for building OCaml code, including
support for tools like `ocamlfind', `ocamlyacc' and `menhir'. In order
to use the functions defined in this section, you need to make sure the
line 
<<open build/OCaml
>>
  is present in your `OMakeroot' file.

13.6.1   Autoconfiguration variables for OCaml compilation
==========================================================
   These variables will get defined based on the "autoconf-style" tests
executed when you run OMake for the first time. You can use them to
configure your project accordingly, and you should not redefine them.
  You can use the `--configure' command line option (Section
A.3.9*Note Subsection A-3-9::) to force re-execution of all the
tests.
 OCAMLOPT_EXISTS
 True when `ocamlopt' (or
`ocamlopt.opt') is available on your machine. 
 OCAMLFIND_EXISTS
 True when the ocamlfind is available
on your machines. 
 OCAMLDEP_MODULES_AVAILABLE
 True when a version of `ocamldep' that
understands the `-modules' option is available on your machine. 
 MENHIR_AVAILABLE
 True when the Menhir parser-generator
is available on your machine.
