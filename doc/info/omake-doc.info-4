8.12   Running OMake from a subdirectory
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

    Running `omake foo' asks OMake to
build the file `foo' in context of the whole project, even when running
from a subdirectory of the project. Therefore, if `bar/baz' is a regular
target (not a `.PHONY' one), then running `omake bar/baz' and running
`(cd bar; omake baz)' are usually equivalent.
  There are two noteworthy exceptions to the above rule: 
  
 - If the subdirectory is not a part of the project (there is no
   `.SUBDIRS') for it, then OMake will complain if you try to run it in
   that directory. 
 - If a subdirectory contains an `OMakeroot' of its own, this would
   designate the subdirectory as a separate project (which is usually a
   bad idea and is not recommended).

8.12.1   Phony targets in a subdirectory
========================================
   \@n
ame{@default64}
  Suppose you have a `.PHONY: clean' declared in your root `OMakefile'
and both the root `OMakefile' and the `OMakefile' in some of the
subdirectories contain `clean:' rules. In this case 
  
 - Running `omake clean' in the root directory will execute all the
   rules (each in the appropriate directory); 
 - Running `omake clean' in the subdirectory will execute just its local
   one, as well as the ones from the subdirectories of the current
   directory. 
  
  The above equally applies to the built-in `.PHONY' targets, including
'.DEFAULT'. Namely, if OMake is executed (without argument) in the root
directory of a project, all the `.DEFAULT' targets in the project will
be built. On the other hand, when OMake is executed (without argument)
in a subdirectory, only the `.DEFAULT' targets defined in and under that
subdirectory will be built.
  The following Section explains the underlying semantics that gives
rise to the above behavior.

8.12.2   Hierarchy of '.PHONY' targets
======================================
   
  When the the root `OMakefile' contains a `.PHONY: clean' directive, it
creates: 
  
 - A "global" phony target `/.PHONY/clean' (note the leading "`/'"); 
 - A "relative" phony target attached to the current directory ---
   `.PHONY/clean' (note the lack of the leading "`/'"); 
 - A dependency `/.PHONY/clean: .PHONY/clean'. 
  
  All the `clean: ...' rules in the root `OMakefile' following this
`.PHONY: clean' declaration would be interpreted as rules for the
`.PHONY/clean' target.
  Now when OMake then comes across a `.SUBDIRS: foo' directive (when it
is in scope of the above `.PHONY: clean' declaration), it does the
following: 
  
 - Creates a new `.PHONY/foo/clean' "relative" phony target; 
 - Creates the dependency `.PHONY/clean: .PHONY/foo/clean'; 
 - Processes the body of the `.SUBDIRS: foo' directive, or reads the
   `foo/OMakefile' file, if the body is empty. While doing that, it
   interprets its instructions relative to the `foo' directory. In
   particular, all the `clean: ...' rules will be taken to apply to
   `.PHONY/foo/clean'. 
  
  Now when you run `omake clean' in the root directory of the project,
it is interpreted as `omake .PHONY/clean' (similar to how it happens
with the normal targets), so both the rules for `.PHONY/clean' are
executed and the rules for its dependency  `.PHONY/foo/clean'. Running
`(cd foo; omake clean)' is, as for normal targets, equivalent to running
`omake .PHONY/foo/clean' and only those rules that apply to
`.PHONY/foo/clean' will be executed.

8.13   Pathnames in rules
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  In rules, the targets and dependencies are first translated to file
values (as in the 'file' function). They are then translated to strings
for the command line. This can cause some unexpected behavior. In the
following example, the 'absname' function is the absolute pathname for
the file `a', but the rule still prints the relative pathname.
<<    .PHONY: demo
      demo: $(absname a)
          echo $<
  
      # omake demo
      a
>>
  
  There is arguably a good reason for this. On Win32 systems, the `/'
character is viewed as an "option specifier." The pathname separator is
the `\' character. OMake translates the filenames automatically so that
things work as expected on both systems.
<<   demo: a/b
         echo $<
  
     # omake demo (on a Unix system)
     a/b
     # omake demo (on a Win32 system)
     a\b
>>
  
  Sometimes you may wish that target strings to be passed literally to
the commands in the rule. One way to do this is to specify them
literally.
<<    SRC = a/b $(absname c/d)
      demo: $(SRC)
          echo $(SRC)
  
      # omake demo (on a Win32 system)
      a/b c:\...\c\d
>>
  
  Alternately, you might wish that filenames be automatically expanded
to absolute pathnames. For example, this might be useful when parsing
the OMake output to look for errors. For this, you can use the
`--absname' option (Section A.3.20*Note Subsection A-3-20::). If you
call `omake' with the `--absname' option, all filenames will be expanded
to absolute names.
<<    # omake --absname demo (on a Unix system)
      /home/.../a/b /home/.../c/d
>>
  
  Alternately, the `--absname' option is scoped. If you want to use it
for only a few rules, you can use the 'OMakeFlags' function to control
how it is applied.
<<   section
        OMakeFlags(--absname)
        demo: a
            echo $<
  
     # omake demo
     /home/.../a
>>
  
  N.B. The `--absname' option is currently an experimental feature.

9.1   Builtin variables
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

   
 OMAKE_VERSION
 Version of OMake. 
 STDLIB
 The directory where the OMake standard
library files reside. At startup, the default value is determined as
follows. 
  
 - The value of the `OMAKELIB' environment variable, if set (must
   contain an absolute path, if set), otherwise 
 - On Windows, the registry keys
   `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\MetaPRL\OMake\OMAKELIB' and
   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MetaPRL\OMake\OMAKELIB' are looked up
   and the value is used, if exist. 
 - Otherwise a compile-time default it used. 
   The current default value may be accessed by running `omake
--version' 
 OMAKEPATH
 An array of directories specifying the
lookup path for the `include' and `open' directives (see Section
4.7*Note Section 4-7::). The default value is an array of two
elements --- `.' and `$(STDLIB)'. 
 OSTYPE
 Set to the machine architecture omake is
running on. Possible values are `Unix' (for all Unix versions, including
Linux and Mac OS X), `Win32' (for MS-Windows, OMake compiled with MSVC++
or Mingw), and `Cygwin' (for MS-Windows, OMake compiled with Cygwin). 
 SYSNAME
 The name of the operating system for the
current machine. 
 NODENAME
 The hostname of the current machine. 
 OS_VERSION
 The operating system release. 
 MACHINE
 The machine architecture, e.g. `i386',
`sparc', etc. 
 HOST
 Same as `NODENAME'. 
 USER
 The login name of the user executing
the process. 
 HOME
 The home directory of the user
executing the process. 
 PID
 The OMake process id. 
 TARGETS
 The command-line target strings. For
example, if OMake is invoked with the following command line, 
<<      omake CFLAGS=1 foo bar.c
>>
  
  then `TARGETS' is defined as `foo bar.c'.
 BUILD_SUMMARY
 The `BUILD_SUMMARY' variable refers to
the file that `omake' uses to summarize a build (the message that is
printed at the very end of a build). The file is empty when the build
starts. If you wish to add additional messages to the build summary, you
can edit/modify this file during the build.
  For example, if you want to point out that some action was taken, you
can append a message to the build summary.
<<   foo: boo
         echo "The file foo was built" >> $(BUILD_SUMMARY)
         ...build foo...
>>
  
 VERBOSE
 Whether certain commands should be
verbose. A boolean flag that is `false' by default and is set to `true'
when OMake is invoked with the `--verbose' option.

9.2   Logic, Boolean functions, and control flow
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   
  Boolean values in omake are represented by case-insensitive strings.
The false value can be represented by the strings `false', `no', `nil',
`undefined' or `0', and everything else is true.

9.2.1   not
===========

<<   $(not e) : String
        e : String
>>
  
  The `not' function negates a Boolean value.
  For example, `$(not false)' expands to the string `true', and `$(not
hello world)' expands to `false'.

9.2.2   equal
=============

<<   $(equal e1, e2) : String
        e1 : String
        e2 : String
>>
  
  The `equal' function tests for equality of two values.
  For example `$(equal a, b)' expands to `false', and `$(equal hello
world, hello world)' expands to `true'.

9.2.3   and
===========

<<    $(and e1, ..., en) : String
         e1, ..., en: Sequence
>>
  
  The `and' function evaluates to the conjunction of its arguments.
  For example, in the following code, `X' is true, and `Y' is false.
<<    A = a
      B = b
      X = $(and $(equal $(A), a) true $(equal $(B), b))
      Y = $(and $(equal $(A), a) true $(equal $(A), $(B)))
>>

9.2.4   or
==========

<<   $(or e1, ..., en) : String
        e1, ..., en: String Sequence
>>
  
  The `or' function evaluates to the disjunction of its arguments.
  For example, in the following code, `X' is true, and `Y' is false.
<<    A = a
      B = b
      X = $(or $(equal $(A), a) false $(equal $(A), $(B)))
      Y = $(or $(equal $(A), $(B)) $(equal $(A), b))
>>

9.2.5   if
==========
\@na
me{@default87}
<<    $(if e1, e2[, e3]) : value
         e1 : String
         e2, e3 : value
>>
  
  The `if' function represents a conditional based on a Boolean value.
For example `$(if $(equal a, b), c, d)' evaluates to `d'.
  Conditionals may also be declared with an alternate syntax.
<<   if e1
        body1
     elseif e2
        body2
     ...
     else
        bodyn
>>
  
  If the expression `e1' is not false, then the expressions in `body1'
are evaluated and the result is returned as the value of the
conditional. Otherwise, if `e1' evaluates to false, the evaluation
continues with the `e2' expression. If none of the conditional
expressions is true, then the expressions in `bodyn' are evaluated and
the result is returned as the value of the conditional.
  There can be any number of `elseif' clauses; the `else' clause is
optional.
  Note that each branch of the conditional defines its own scope, so
variables defined in the branches are normally not visible outside the
conditional. The `export' command may be used to export the variables
defined in a scope. For example, the following expression represents a
common idiom for defining the C compiler configuration.
<<   if $(equal $(OSTYPE), Win32)
        CC = cl
        CFLAGS += /DWIN32
        export
     else
        CC = gcc
        CFLAGS += -g -O2
        export

9.2.6   switch, match
=====================

  The `switch' and `match' functions perform pattern matching.
  `$(switch <arg>, <pattern_1>, <value_1>, ..., <pattern_n>, <value_n>)'
`$(match <arg>, <pattern_1>, <value_1>, ..., <pattern_n>, <value_n>)'
  The number of `<pattern>/<value>' pairs is arbitrary. They strictly
alternate; the total number of arguments to `<match>' must be odd.
  The `<arg>' is evaluated to a string, and compared with `<pattern_1>'.
If it matches, the result of the expression is `<value_1>'. Otherwise
evaluation continues with the remaining patterns until a match is found.
If no pattern matches, the value is the empty string.
  The `switch' function uses string comparison to compare the argument
with the patterns. For example, the following expression defines the
`FILE' variable to be either `foo', `bar', or the empty string,
depending on the value of the `OSTYPE' variable.
<<    FILE = $(switch $(OSTYPE), Win32, foo, Unix, bar)
>>
  
  The `match' function uses regular expression patterns (see the `grep'
function). If a match is found, the variables `$1, $2, ...' are bound to
the substrings matched between `\(' and `\)' delimiters. The `$0'
variable contains the entire match, and `$*' is an array of the matched
substrings. to the matched substrings.
<<    FILE = $(match foo_xyz/bar.a, foo_\\\(.*\\\)/\\\(.*\\\)\.a,
foo_$2/$1.o)
>>
  
  The `switch' and `match' functions also have an alternate (more
usable) form.
<<   match e
     case pattern1
        body1
     case pattern2
        body2
     ...
     default
        bodyd
>>
  
  If the value of expression `e' matches `pattern_i' and no previous
pattern, then `body_i' is evaluated and returned as the result of the
`match'. The `switch' function uses string comparison; the `match'
function uses regular expression matching.
<<   match $(FILE)
     case $".*\(\.[^\/.]*\)"
        println(The string $(FILE) has suffix $1)
     default
        println(The string $(FILE) has no suffix)
>>

9.2.7   try
===========

<<   try
        try-body
     catch class1(v1)
        catch-body
     when expr
        when-body
     ...
     finally
        finally-body
>>
  
  The `try' form is used for exception handling. First, the expressions
in the `try-body' are evaluated.
  If evaluation results in a value `v' without raising an exception,
then the expressions in the `finally-body' are evaluated and the value
`v' is returned as the result.
  If evaluation of the `try-body' results in a exception object `obj',
the `catch' clauses are examined in order. When examining `catch' clause
`catch class(v)', if the exception object `obj' is an instance of the
class name `class', the variable `v' is bound to the exception object,
and the expressions in the `catch-body' are evaluated.
  If a `when' clause is encountered while a `catch' body is being
evaluated, the predicate `expr' is evaluated. If the result is true,
evaluation continues with the expressions in the `when-body'. Otherwise,
the next `catch' clause is considered for evaluation.
  If evaluation of a `catch-body' or `when-body' completes successfully,
returning a value `v', without encountering another `when' clause, then
the expressions in the `finally-body' are evaluated and the value `v' is
returned as the result.
  There can be any number of `catch' clauses; the `finally' clause is
optional.

9.2.8   raise
=============

<<   raise exn
        exn : Exception
>>
  
  The `raise' function raises an exception. The `exn' object can be any
object. However, the normal convention is to raise an 'Exception'
object.
  If the exception is never caught, the whole object will be verbosely
printed in the error message. However, if the object is an `Exception'
one and contains a `message' field, only that field will be included in
the error message.

============

<<   exit(code)
        code : Int

  The `exit' function terminates omake abnormally.
  `$(exit <code>)'
  The `exit' function takes one integer argument, which is exit code.
Non-zero values indicate abnormal termination.

9.2.10   defined
================

<<   $(defined sequence) : String
        sequence : Sequence
>>
  
  The `defined' function test whether all the variables in the sequence
are currently defined. For example, the following code defines the `X'
variable if it is not already defined.
<<    if $(not $(defined X))
         X = a b c
         export
>>
  
  It is acceptable to use qualified names.

9.2.11   defined-env
====================

<<   $(defined-env sequence) : String
        sequence : String
>>
  
  The `defined-env' function tests whether a variable is defined as part
of the process environment.
  For example, the following code adds the `-g' compile option if the
environment variable `DEBUG' is defined.
<<if $(defined-env DEBUG)
      CFLAGS += -g

9.2.12   getenv
===============

<<   $(getenv name) : String
     $(getenv name, default) : String
>>
  
  The `getenv' function gets the value of a variable from the process
environment. The function takes one or two arguments.
  In the single argument form, an exception is raised if the variable
variable is not defined in the environment. In the two-argument form,
the second argument is returned as the result if the value is not
defined.
  For example, the following code defines the variable `X' to be a
space-separated list of elements of the `PATH' environment variable if
it is defined, and to `/bin /usr/bin' otherwise.
<<    X = $(split $(PATHSEP), $(getenv PATH, /bin:/usr/bin))

     get-registry(hkey, key, field, default) : String
         hkey : String
         key : String
         field : String
>>
  
  The `get-registry' function retrieves a string value from the system
registry on Win32. On other architectures, there is no registry.
  The `hive' (I think that is the right word), indicates which part of
the registry to use. It should be one of the following values.
  
  
 - `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT' 
 - `HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG' 
 - `HKEY_CURRENT_USER' 
 - `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE' 
 - `HKEY_USERS' 
   Refer to the Microsoft documentation if you want to know what these
mean.
  The `key' is the field you want to get from the registry. It should
have a form like `A\B\C' (if you use forward slashes, they will be
converted to backslashes). The field is the sub-field of the key.
  In the 4-argument form, the `default' is returned on failure. You may
also use the alternate form.
<<    get-registry(hkey, key, field)
         default

  The `getvar' function gets the value of a variable.
  An exception is raised if the variable variable is not defined.
  For example, the following code defines X to be the string abc.
<<    NAME = foo
      foo_1 = abc
      X = $(getvar $(NAME)_1)

following code defines the variable `X' to be the string `abc'.
<<   NAME = X
     setvar($(NAME), abc)
>>
  
  It is acceptable to use qualified names.

9.3.1   array
=============

<<    $(array elements) : Array
         elements : Sequence
>>
  
  The `array' function creates an array from a sequence. If the `<arg>'
is a string, the elements of the array are the whitespace-separated
elements of the string, respecting quotes.
  In addition, array variables can be declared as follows.
<<    A[] =
         <val1>
         ...
         <valn>
>>
  
  In this case, the elements of the array are exactly `<val1>', ...,
`<valn>', and whitespace is preserved literally.

9.3.2   split
=============

<<   $(split sep, elements) : Array
        sep : String
        elements : Sequence
>>
  
  The `split' function takes two arguments, a string of separators, and
a string argument. The result is an array of elements determined by
splitting the elements by all occurrence of the separator in the
`elements' sequence.
  For example, in the following code, the `X' variable is defined to be
the array `/bin /usr/bin /usr/local/bin'.
<<    PATH = /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
      X = $(split :, $(PATH))
>>
  
  The `sep' argument may be omitted. In this case `split' breaks its
arguments along the white space. Quotations are not split.

sequence of elements. The result is a string formed by concatenating the
elements, placing the separator between adjacent elements.
  For example, in the following code, the `X' variable is defined to be
the string `foo_x_bar_x_baz'.
<<    X = foo  bar     baz
      Y = $(concat _x_, $(X))

>>
  
  The `string-escaped' function converts each element of its argument to
a string, escaping it, if it contains symbols that are special to OMake.
The special characters include `:()\,$'"#' and whitespace. This function
can be used in scanner rules to escape file names before printing then
to `stdout'.
  The `ocaml-escaped' function converts each element of its argument to
a string, escaping characters that are special to OCaml.
  The `c-escaped' function converts a string to a form that can be used
as a string constant in C.
  The `id-escaped' function turns a string into an identifier that may
be used in OMake.
  The `html-escaped' function turns a literal string into a form
acceptable as HTML. The `html-pre-escaped' function is similar, but it
does not translate newlines into `<br>'.

==============

<<   $(shell command) : Array
     $(shella command) : Array
     $(shell-code command) : Int
        command : Sequence
>>
  
  The `shell' function evaluates a command using the command shell, and
returns the whitespace-separated words of the standard output as the
result.
  The `shella' function acts similarly, but it returns the lines as
separate items in the array.
  The `shell-code' function returns the exit code. The output is not
diverted.
  For example, if the current directory contains the files `OMakeroot',
`OMakefile', and `hello.c', then `$(shell ls)' evaluates to `hello.c
OMakefile OMakeroot' (on a Unix system).

9.3.41   export
===============
 The `export'
function allows one to capture the current environment in a variable.
  For example, the following code: 
<<A = 1
  B = 1
  C = 1
  SAVE_ENV = $(export A B)
  A = 2
  B = 2
  C = 2
  export $(SAVE_ENV)
  println($A $B $C)
>>
  will print `1 1 2'.
  The arguments to this function are interpreted the exact same way as
the arguments to the `export' special form (see Section
6.3*Note Section 6-3::).

9.3.42   while
==============

<<   while <test>
        <body>
>>
  
  --or--
<<    while <test>
      case <test1>
         <body1>
      ...
      case <testn>
         <bodyn>
      default
         <bodyd>
>>
  
  The loop is executed while the test is true. In the first form, the
`<body>' is executed on every loop iteration. In the second form, the
body `<bodyI>' is selected, as the first case where the test `<testI>'
is true. If none apply, the optional default case is evaluated. If no
cases are true, the loop exits. The environment is automatically
exported.
  Examples.
  Iterate for `i' from `0' to `9'.
<<    i = 0
      while $(lt $i, 10)
         echo $i
         i = $(add $i, 1)
>>
  
  The following example is equivalent.
<<   i = 0
     while true
     case $(lt $i, 10)
        echo $i
        i = $(add $i, 1)
>>
  
  The following example is similar, but some special cases are printed.
value is printed.
<<    i = 0
      while $(lt $i, 10)
      case $(equal $i, 0)
         echo zero
      case $(equal $i, 1)
         echo one
      default
         echo $i
>>
  
  The 'break' function can be used to break out of the `while' loop
early.

9.3.44   random, random-init
============================

<<    random-init(i)
          i : Int
      random() : Int
>>
  
  Produce a random number. The numbers are pseudo-random, and are not
cryptographically secure.
  The generator is initialized form semi-random system data. Subsequent
runs should produce different results. The `rando-init' function can be
used to return the generator to a known state.

9.5.1   fun
===========

  The `fun' form introduces anonymous functions.
  `$(fun <v1>, ..., <vn>, <body>)'
  The last argument is the body of the function. The other arguments are
the parameter names.
  The three following definitions are equivalent.
<<    F(X, Y) =
         return($(addsuffix $(Y), $(X)))
  
      F = $(fun X, Y, $(addsuffix $(Y), $(X)))
  
      F =
         fun(X, Y)
            value $(addsuffix $(Y), $(X))

  Suppose we have the following function definition.
<<    F(X, Y) =
         return($(addsuffix $(Y), $(X)))
>>
  
  The the two expressions below are equivalent.

arguments.
  `$(applya <fun>, <args>)'
  For example, in the following program, the value of `Z' is `file.c'.
<<    F(X, Y) =
         return($(addsuffix $(Y), $(X)))
      args[] =
         file
         .c
      Z = $(applya $(F), $(args))
